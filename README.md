Seeds framework
===============

Seeds is a framework that sits on the top of emberJS and requireJS stack.

It glues together both libs concerns, helping developer coding efficient and more readable code.

Currently at an early stage of development, this repo provides the framework and an example of usage, which is used to test and develop new features

# Goals

- Provide an easy-to-write plugin system with dependancy support, with dynamic reconfiguration at load-time and run-time
- Lower the amount of code repetition, with "convention over configuration" and "KISS" patterns
- Help developers to write efficient documentation for functionnal concerns
- Add "testing scenarios" feature, to configure test routines configured directly on the webapp, and launch them in headless browsers

# Features

//TODO
